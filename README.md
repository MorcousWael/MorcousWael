I‚Äôm a Frontend Developer at Link Development, where I work on enterprise-scale Angular applications with a focus on clean architecture, responsiveness, and performance.

I hold a dual-degree in Computer Engineering from Ain Shams University, and throughout my academic and professional journey, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation across web, mobile, and data-related technologies.
In addition to frontend development, I‚Äôve worked on mobile apps using Flutter, as well as data analysis projects involving preprocessing, classification models, and outlier detection.
My technical skill set includes Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and more ‚Äî enabling me to contribute effectively across different domains. I‚Äôm passionate about clean code, thoughtful UI design, and continuous learning in the ever-evolving world of software engineering.

Today, I combine my experience in Angular and Flutter to create practical, user-focused applications, and I‚Äôm constantly pushing myself to grow in both performance and design.
