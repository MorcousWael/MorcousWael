I’m a Frontend Developer at Link Development, working on enterprise-scale Angular applications with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, responsive design, and performance optimization.

I hold a dual degree in Computer Engineering from Ain Shams University and the University of East London. Throughout both my academic and professional journey, I’ve developed a solid foundation in web, mobile, and data-focused technologies.

Alongside frontend development, I’ve built mobile apps using Flutter, and gained hands-on experience in data analysis, including preprocessing, classification models, and outlier detection.
My technical skill set includes Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, Flutter, Python, Java, and more — allowing me to contribute effectively across different domains. I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, crafting thoughtful UI/UX, and continuously growing as a developer in the ever-evolving world of software engineering.

Today, I combine my experience in Angular and Flutter to create practical, user-focused applications, and I’m constantly pushing myself to grow in both performance and design.
