I‚Äôm a Frontend Developer at Link Development, where I work on enterprise-scale Angular applications with a focus on clean architecture and responsive UI.

I graduated from Ain Shams University with a degree in Computer Engineering. During college, I explored various programming technologies but found a strong passion for mobile development ‚Äî especially Flutter. I built multiple projects using Flutter, both for academic requirements and through self-driven learning.

Today, I combine my experience in Angular and Flutter to create practical, user-focused applications, and I‚Äôm constantly pushing myself to grow in both performance and design.
